# Priority queue with simple example

## Given task
User A sends a message to user B. The message is divided to smaller packages of given size. Each packet has an ID, which are consecutive numbers. User B recives the packages in a random order. Then he should sort the packages by thier priority. 
My task was to implement an ADT structure to handle this problem.

## Performance testing
In addition I conducted tests of the execution time of the operation depending on the number of packets.
Results are shown in ``PAMSI_1.pdf`` file that is written in Polish.

## Running the program
After cloning the repository simply run `make` command. Later you can run the program using `./pri.out`.
